# Weather-Dashboard
In this project my job was to create a weather dashboard that forecasts the weather 5 days in advanced. As well users can save the search that is in the localstorage.

# About the project
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap!
Within the code I followed a tutorial that helped me understand the functions in Javascript. As well on how to link api keys to retreive data about the weather. I also created anopenweather account to generate my api key.

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
